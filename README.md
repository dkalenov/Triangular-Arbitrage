# Triangular Arbitrage for Crypto with Python - (Fast Track)


## Project objectives
Write an algorithm to calculate Triangular Arbitrage with depth on Centralised and Decentralised exchanges.

## Project description
I am studying Triangular Arbitrage for Crypto with Python - (Fast Track). This course focuses on identifying and exploiting Triangular Arbitrage opportunities in the Cryptocurrency market on both Centralised (CeFi) and Decentralised (DeFi) exchanges using Python and Javascript.

## Key Concepts:
Triangular Arbitrage: Gain a deep understanding of Arbitrage with a focus on Triangular Arbitrage.
Programming Languages: Develop Triangular Arbitrage algorithms using Python and Javascript.
Exchanges: Explore both CeFi (Poloniex) and DeFi (Uniswap V3) exchanges.
Course Highlights:
Establish all traceable Triangular Arbitrage pairs.
Calculate surface rate opportunities across all pairs.
Calculate real rates for arbitrage with depth.
Extract data using Poloniex Rest API endpoints.
Read blockchain price information using Web3 and Ethers JS.
Work with the Uniswap V3 SDK.
Fun and memorable programming approach for beginners.


## Tasks
Gain a deep understanding of Arbitrage with a particular focus on Triangular Arbitrage.
Develop Python and Javascript skills for implementing Triangular Arbitrage algorithms.
Establish and trace Triangular Arbitrage pairs unnoticed by others.
Calculate surface rate opportunities across all pairs.
Calculate real rates for arbitrage with depth.
Implement logic on both CeFi (Poloniex exchange) and DeFi (Uniswap V3) platforms.
Extract data from the web using Poloniex Rest API endpoints.
Read and analyze blockchain price information using Web3 and Ethers JS.
Utilize the Uniswap V3 SDK for DeFi implementations.
